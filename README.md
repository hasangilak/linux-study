## STAR Method Teaching Approach

This curriculum uses the **STAR Method** to teach Linux concepts through production scenarios:

### STAR Learning Framework:
- **Situation**: Real-world production problems with business impact
- **Task**: Clear objectives with measurable success criteria  
- **Action**: Step-by-step technical solutions with commands
- **Result**: Quantifiable improvements and lessons learned

### Enhanced Learning Features:
- **Production Scenarios**: Every concept taught through actual crisis situations
- **Business Context**: Financial impact, deadlines, and stakeholder pressure
- **Quantifiable Results**: Performance improvements, cost savings, uptime gains
- **Practical Commands**: Immediately applicable technical solutions
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from basic to advanced scenarios

### For Each Lesson:
1. **Learn** through STAR scenarios with real business impact
2. **Practice** with production-grade commands and techniques
3. **Complete** STAR Learning Exercises requiring critical thinking
4. **Apply** knowledge using scenario-based quick reference guides
5. **Document** your solutions and preventive measures

### Recommended Schedule:
- **Week 1-2**: System Architecture (Lessons 1-5)
- **Week 3-4**: File Systems & Storage (Lessons 6-11)
- **Week 5-6**: Process Management (Lessons 12-16)
- **Week 7-8**: Networking (Lessons 17-22)
- **Week 9-10**: Security (Lessons 23-27)
- **Week 11-12**: Advanced Topics (Lessons 28-32)

## Lab Environment Setup

Create a dedicated lab environment:
```bash
# Install essential tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git vim tmux htop iotop sysstat strace ltrace

# Create lab directory
mkdir -p ~/linux-lab/{scripts,configs,logs}
cd ~/linux-lab
```
